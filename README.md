## Feature Improvement and Scaling Solutions

### 1. How can you improve the feature to make it more resilient against abuse/exploitation?
**Answer**: By implementing the `express-rate-limit` library, we can prevent too many requests from the same IP address (user). This helps mitigate the risk of abuse and ensures fair usage of the service.

### 2. How can you improve the feature to scale to millions of users and perform without issues?
**Answer**: By using an Application/Network Load Balancer and deploying the application across different servers, the load balancer can distribute requests evenly among the servers. This ensures better performance and availability.
